# DarkSkyWeather
DarkSky Weather plugin for Vera UI7 and openLuup.

This plugin gets weather and forcast data from https://darksky.net.

After installation via the MiOS or ALTUI App store you must get a API key at http://darksky.net/dev. 
Normally the plugin is set to refresh every 30 minutes or 48 times per day, so well under the free threshold.

Look at the Wiki(https://github.com/reneboer/DarkSkyWeather/wiki) for full documentation.

You can follow the discussion on this plugin on the Vera Community at https://community.getvera.com/t/plugin-darksky-weather/207959

Thanks to logread for the initial development.
